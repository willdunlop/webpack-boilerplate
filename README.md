# Webpack boiler

### JSX - Threejs
This particular branch is set up to use both three.js and jsx-render (without react).
This is for projects that can utilize the componentization of jsx mixed with the traditional dom manipulation of vanilla js.
It also removes react bloat from the vendor package.
